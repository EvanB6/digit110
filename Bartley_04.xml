<MC>Booker T.</MC>
Was a practical man.
He said, <Job type="farmer" Real="not sure">Till the soil
And learn from the land.
Let down your bucket</Job>
Where you are.
Your fate is here
And not afar.
To help yourself
And your fellow man,
Train your head,
Your heart, <orig type="underlined">and your hand</orig>. <!-- orignal text had the words underlined -->
For smartness alone's
Surely not meet—
If you haven't at the same time
Got something to eat.
Thus at <City loc="Alabama">Tuskegee</City>
He built a school
<teachings type="knowledge">With book-learning there</teachings>
<teachings type="trades">And the workman's tool.</teachings>
He started out
In a simple way—
For yesterday
Was <orig type="underlined">not</orig><!-- orignal text had the words underlined --> today.
Sometimes he had
Compromise in his talk—
For a man must crawl
Before he can walk—
And in <state>Alabama</state> in <date time="1985">'85</date>
A joker was lucky
To be alive.
But <MC>Booker T.</MC>
Was nobody's fool:
You may carve a dream
With an humble tool.
The tallest tower
Can tumble down
If it be not rooted
In solid ground.
So, being a far-seeing

Practical man,
He said, Train your head,
Your heart, <orig type="underlined">and your hand</orig>. <!-- orignal text had the words underlined -->
Your fate is here
And not afar,
So let down your bucket
Where you are.
