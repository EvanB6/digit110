    <title>Shrewsbury Cakes: Original Recipe.</title>
    <intro>This recipe comes from <recipebook>MS Codex 625</recipebook>, a manuscript recipe book
        that belonged to a <chef type="student">student in a London cooking school</chef> in the
        early <date>eighteenth century</date>. The pastry school was owned by <Owner type="school"
            >Edward Kidder</Owner>, who taught at a few locations in London between around 1720 and
        1734. Blank books with printed title pages seem to have been used by students to write down
        recipes they learned. Kidder also published his recipes in the printed volume, Receipts for
        Pastry and Cookery, in 1720. <origsteps><step>Take a pound of fresh butter a pound of double

    <steplist>
        <step n="1">Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar. </step>
        <step n="2">Then add the eggs and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks
            curdled.</step>
        <step n="3">Sift together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined. </step>
        <step n="4">Scoop and roll the dough by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat.</step>
        <step n="opt">[You could also refrigerate the dough until it’s firm enough to roll out on a
            flat surface and cut out into rounds.]</step> <step n="5">Bake at 350F for 15-18 minutes
            (ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you could roll them thinner and have a slightly shorter
            cooking time).</step>
        <step n="6">They’re done once they turn the slightest bit brown around the edges. This
            halved recipe yielded about two dozen cookies.</step>

    <Results>The Results If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these.
        <!--> never had one before <--> We added the cinnamon because we like it and couldn’t
        resist, and we thought it rounded out the mace nicely. These are mild, fairly soft cookies
        that are great with tea. We rolled and patted the dough into individual cookies because it
        was too soft and stick to roll out, but a little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge
        might make the dough easier to work with a rolling pin.</Results>
